3. Number of Instances:  1000

Two datasets are provided.  the original dataset, in the form provided
by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and
is in the file "german.data".   
 
For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University 
produced the file "german.data-numeric".  This file has been edited 
and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for 
algorithms which cannot cope with categorical variables.   Several
attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute 17) have
been coded as integer.    This was the form used by StatLog.

8.  Cost Matrix

This dataset requires use of a cost matrix (see below)


      1        2
----------------------------
  1   0        1
-----------------------
  2   5        0

(1 = Good,  2 = Bad)

the rows represent the actual classification and the columns
the predicted classification.

It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), 
than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (1).
